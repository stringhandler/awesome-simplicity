# Awesome Simplicity [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of resources, tools, libraries, and projects related to [Simplicity](https://github.com/ElementsProject/simplicity) and SimplicityHL — the low-level and high-level blockchain scripting languages designed for safe, expressive smart contracts.

Simplicity is a typed, combinator-based functional language for cryptocurrencies. SimplicityHL is a higher-level language that compiles to Simplicity, making it more accessible to developers.
